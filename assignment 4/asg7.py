"""Nidhi's father is not able to calculate his annual tax correctly. He is a bit 
confused with the taxation rule also each year his total annual income is different.
 So to help her father Nidhi decides to write a python program that can calculate 
 the tax to be paid based on annual income. Write the same program to calculate the 
 tax to be paid based on annual income. ‚óè Hint: take the annual income as input from 
 the user and print the amount of tax to be paid. These are tax rules."""
