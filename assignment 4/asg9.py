"""A year consists of 365 days. But once in every four years, it consists of 366 days.
And that is known as a leap year. Shisha wants to know whether the current year is a
leap year or not. She found that any year divisible by 4 is a leap year, if the 
year is divisible by 100 then it will not be a leap year, and if the year is
divisible by 400 then it will be a leap year. Write a program in python to check 
whether the given year is a leap year or not to help Shisha. 
● Hint: Use if elif else condition"""
